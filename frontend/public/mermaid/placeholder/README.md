Place versioned Mermaid ESM builds here, e.g. public/mermaid/10.6.0/mermaid.esm.js. Files are served statically by Vite so the frontend can load multiple versions side-by-side.

Tips:
- Download ESM bundles from npm (mermaid@<version>/dist/mermaid.esm.mjs) and copy as `public/mermaid/<version>/mermaid.esm.js`.
- Include multiple versions (e.g., 10.6.0, 9.4.3, 8.4.8) to enable compare mode across releases.
